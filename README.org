#+title: Orgonomic

* Summary

Orgonomic replaces return and backspace in org-mode with versions that behave
more like they do in a word processor. That is, return at the end of a bulletted
list will extend the list. A second return will delete the hanging bullet.
Backspace in a bulleted list will delete the bullet or reduce its level by one
if it indented. The same is true for headline levels.

* Installation

This package is not on MELPA. The below instructions assume you are using

install it however you typically install packages that are not available on MELPA.
